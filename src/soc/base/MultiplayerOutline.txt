Multiplayer Outline

1) Ask client for server address
    - The address entered is invalid
        Notify the client, tell them why it is invalid, and then let them revise it
    - The address entered is valid, but a connection could not be established
        Notify the client and ask them to double-check that the address is correct
    - A connection is established
        Proceed to the next step

2) Ask client for name
    - Name is already taken by another player in the same lobby
        Notify the client and ask them to enter a different name
   	- No other players in the lobby have the specified name
        Give the name to the player, add them to the lobby, and notify everyone else via chat

3) Display lobby and allow players to select their color and say that they're ready (via checkbox)
    - A player selects a color that has already been selected by a player that is ready
        Disable the checkbox
    - A player selects a color that has not already been selected by a player that is ready
        Enable the checkbox
    - A player becomes ready and another player has the first player's color selected
        Disable the checkbox for the player who is not ready
    - A player clicks the checkbox before the client has been notified that their selected color has been taken
        Un-check the checkbox and disable it
    - A player disconnects
        Remove them from the lobby and re-enable the checkbox for any player(s) who had the disconnected player's color selected
    - All players are ready
        Proceed to the next step

4) Generate a board and let players vote to use it or to generate another one
    - A player does not vote
        Only allow players to vote for a certain amount of time (1 minute?)
    - The vote is a tie
        Discard the current board and generate another one (or randomly decide to keep it or to discard it?)
    - A player wants to change their vote
        Allow players to change their vote until the vote time expires

5) Randomly generate the turn order and show it to all players
