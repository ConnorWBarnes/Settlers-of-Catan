# Settlers of Catan

A recreation of the board game known as "Settlers of Catan"
=======
This is a recreation of the board game known as "Settlers of Catan" using the Java programming language. It is no longer a demonstration of my current programming ability because I have learned better and more efficient algorithms and implementations during my time at UC Santa Cruz.

NOTE: Development on this project has been temporarily suspended because I recently transferred to UC Santa Cruz. While I will continue to work on this project, I am currently enrolled in enough classes to be considered a full-time student so development will be slow and commits will be sparse.

UPDATE: Local multiplayer is currently supported, and online multiplayer is currently in the works.
